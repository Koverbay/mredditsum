You can test with some fashion tape.  If needed, this tortoiseshell button type looks fairly common, you can prob pick one up from a craft store to add onto wherever you add stitches.\n\nHarder version: take in the shoulder seams a little, so the dress sits higher and therefore covers up the chest a little more.  Can be a little hard/not super feasible depending on how it currently fits the rest of your body.\n\nAlso for your original question, I like the bralettes at aerie and the camisoles at uniqlo (airism tanks are a wardrobe stable for me) for options to wear inside the dress for now!",

Unfortunately, I'm very definitely not handy at sewing + the v-neck is pretty wide and the dress is pretty snug around my shoulders and on the rest of my body.

I really want to retain the cool airiness of the dress for the summer, so both options sound promising",

The website had a list of designers they carried, and I had called to try on a specific gown, but the tag just had numbers and letters on it.\n\nThe second shop I went to was the exact opposite. She'd bring a gown and mention the designer before going into detail about the dress. \n\nAnd my experience at the second shop was lightyears better than the first. At the first I felt like I was playing dress up. She didn't help me or anything. I just picked things off the rack to try and she didn't help me into anything. I'm glad I had a friend with me to zip me up. The second shop was a true bridal salon experience.",
